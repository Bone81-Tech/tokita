Fix: Resolve JavaScript syntax errors and ImageKit SDK loading

JavaScript Fixes:
- Changed const to var with existence checks in imagekit.js and config.js
- Prevents "Identifier already declared" errors when scripts load multiple times
- Added conditional ImageKit initialization to handle SDK load failures gracefully

ImageKit SDK Fix:
- Updated ImageKit SDK URL from broken cdn.imagekit.io to working unpkg.com
- Fixes ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED error

These changes resolve the console errors that were causing layout rendering issues.
